    "**Freehold Raceway is the oldest racetrack in the United States for harnessed horses, established 1854.  It is located on the outskirts of Freehold Borough, which is where I went to high school.  The raceway is across from the Battleground State Park, where a revolutionary war battle was fought.  I loved to mountain bike in the park, pick apples in the orchards and fish on the horse farm ponds surrounding the raceway, and then get a burger and big ice cream sundae at Jersey Freeze, across from the track.  My husband, once picked up a loose license plate in the in Jersey Freeze parking lot, bet on that number horse and won big!  The raceway and surrounding area has many fond memories for us.**"
