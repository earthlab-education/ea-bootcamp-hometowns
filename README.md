The original activity was developed and taught by Jonah Duckles (https://github.com/jduckles/git-collaboration). Many thanks to Jonah Duckles for developing this activity.

This activity has been modified by Earth Lab at CU Boulder for the Earth Analytics Bootcamp course. In this activity, students follow the GitHub collaborative workflow to contribute a Jupyter Notebook with some facts about their hometown (or some other city of their choosing).
